# my_first_calculator.rs
When someone first sent me [my_first_calculator.py](https://github.com/AceLewis/my_first_calculator.py), I thought that
it was a good opportunity to learn some Rust and make my own generator.

## Keep in mind...
I am merely a rust beginner (At the time of writing), so if you have any improvements, open a pull request and I'll be
happy to review it!

### Extra
The attached file is for the numbers 0-50, and is roughly 20,000 lines long (658kb of data). I managed to generate a
188,531,992 line program (a whopping 7 gigabytes of data!), stopping the program halfway through generation since it was taking too long. At larger numbers,
it may take a while to generate.

Thank you to [AceLewis](https://github.com/AceLewis) for creating the original inspiration for this mini-project!
